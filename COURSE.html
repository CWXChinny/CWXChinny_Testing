            INTI organises sharing sessions of visiting professors and industry experts from our international partner universities. This gives students access to firsthand information on current industry practices, latest technologies and real-world problems. Visiting lecturers also collaborate and facilitate study tours with INTI students.

            Regular workshops are conducted to fill in the knowledge-based economy. We invite our own academic staff and guest speakers to cover basic computer skills like hardware troubleshooting, mobile application creation, and coding, in addition to learning about computer Operating System modules developed by SuSE Linux. INTI also offers a course curriculum integrated with Cisco Academy’s advanced learning materials. Upon graduation, INTI’s computer science students will receive a Cisco certified CCNA, an internationally reputable information technology certification. The set of technical skills and experiences acquired are priceless and can be applied to other non-technical fields.

            Apart from designing a robust course syllabus, INTI has collaborated with leading technology companies to organise internships for our students. Past students have had the chance to work for Sony, Western Digital, PWC and more. With the ever-changing landscape of digital technology, INTI has included modules that touch on trending topics like e-commerce and online businesses. There are also additional specialisations in cybersecurity, tech implementation, data application and usage specifically in the scope of business intelligence.

            INTI is the first private higher education institution in Malaysia to offer programmes in collaboration with IBM. As a result of our partnership, IBM-Innovation Center for Education (IBM-ICE) was established. The main role of the centre is to equip INTI computing and IT students with new and relevant IT skills based on the jointly-developed innovative course curriculum by IBM and INTI. The curriculum focuses on the computing skills required in different industry specialisations. For example, industries like banking, education, manufacturing, healthcare and others.
